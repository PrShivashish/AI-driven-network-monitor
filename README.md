## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-monitor.git
cd network-monitor
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Requirements File (requirements.txt)
```
numpy
psutil
scikit-learn
pyqtgraph
PyQt5
ipaddress
```

## 🖥 Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python network_monitor.py
```

### Application Controls
- **Start Monitoring**: Begin network traffic analysis
- **Stop Monitoring**: Pause network monitoring
- **Reset**: Clear current monitoring data
- **Block Suspicious IPs**: Manually trigger IP blocking

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Requires administrative/sudo privileges for IP blocking
- Use in controlled, authorized network environments
- Always obtain proper permissions before monitoring networks

## 🤖 Machine Learning Anomaly Detection

The application uses three advanced machine learning techniques:
1. **Isolation Forest**: Identifies anomalies by isolating outliers
2. **One-Class SVM**: Learns the boundary of normal data
3. **Local Outlier Factor**: Compares local density of data points

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- Low computational overhead
- Real-time processing
- Configurable detection sensitivity

## 🔧 Customization

Modify detection parameters in the `DDoSDetector` class:
- Adjust `history_size`
- Change `anomaly_threshold`
- Configure ML model parameters
